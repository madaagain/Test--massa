Counter Smart Contract Application
Overview
This application includes a simple on-chain smart contract and a basic frontend. The smart contract is designed with two primary functions: increment and trigger_value.

Smart Contract
The smart contract in this project is designed to increment a counter stored on-chain by an amount passed to it. This is done through the increment function, which takes an u32 integer as a parameter. There is also a trigger_value function that triggers an event to display the current value of the counter. This function does not take any parameters.

Frontend
The frontend is a simple user interface that displays the current value of the counter stored in the smart contract.
